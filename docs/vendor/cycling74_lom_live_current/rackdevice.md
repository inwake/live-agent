# RackDevice

This class represents a Live Rack Device.

A RackDevice is a type of Device, meaning that it has all the children, properties and functions that a Device has. Listed below are members unique to RackDevice.

## Children

### chain_selector [DeviceParameter](https://docs.cycling74.com/apiref/lom/deviceparameter/ "DeviceParameter")read-only

Convenience accessor for the Rack's chain selector.

### chains list of [Chain](https://docs.cycling74.com/apiref/lom/chain/ "Chain")read-onlyobserve

The Rack's chains.

### drum_pads list of [DrumPad](https://docs.cycling74.com/apiref/lom/drumpad/ "DrumPad")read-onlyobserve

All 128 Drum Pads for the topmost Drum Rack. Inner Drum Racks return a list of 0 entries.

### return_chains list of [Chain](https://docs.cycling74.com/apiref/lom/chain/ "Chain")read-onlyobserve

The Rack's return chains.

### visible_drum_pads list of [DrumPad](https://docs.cycling74.com/apiref/lom/drumpad/ "DrumPad")read-onlyobserve

All 16 visible DrumPads for the topmost Drum Rack. Inner Drum Racks return a list of 0 entries.

## Properties

### can_show_chains boolread-only

1 = The Rack contains an instrument device that is capable of showing its chains in Session View.

### has_drum_pads boolread-onlyobserve

1 = the device is a Drum Rack with pads. A nested Drum Rack is a Drum Rack without pads.

Only available for Drum Racks.

### has_macro_mappings boolread-onlyobserve

1 = any of a Rack's Macros are mapped to a parameter.

### is_showing_chains boolobserve

1 = The Rack contains an instrument device that is showing its chains in Session View.

### variation_count intread-onlyobserve

The number of currently stored macro variations.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### selected_variation_index int

Get/set the currently selected variation.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### visible_macro_count intread-onlyobserve

The number of currently visible macros.

## Functions

### copy_pad

Parameters:

`source_index` [int]

`destination_index` [int]

Copies all content of a Drum Rack pad from a source pad to a destination pad. The source_index and destination_index refer to pad indices inside a Drum Rack.

### add_macro

Increases the number of visible macro controls.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### insert_chain

Parameters: `index` [int] (optional)

Attempts to insert a new chain at the given index, or at the end of the chain list if no index is provided. Throws an error if insertion is not possible.

Side note: A chain inserted into a Drum Rack will have an initial MIDI In Note setting of "All Notes" (see `DrumChain.in_note`). You likely want the chain to be triggered when a specific pad is played; the way to achieve this is to set the `in_note` to the note value that corresponds to the pad.

_Available since Live 12.3._

### remove_macro

Decreases the number of visible macro controls.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### randomize_macros

Randomizes the values of eligible macro controls.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### store_variation

Stores a new variation of the values of all currently mapped macros.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### recall_selected_variation

Recalls the currently selected macro variation.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### recall_last_used_variation

Recalls the macro variation that was recalled most recently.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### delete_selected_variation

Deletes the currently selected macro variation. Does nothing if there is no selected variation.

_Available since Live 11.0._
