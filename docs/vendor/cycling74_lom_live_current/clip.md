# Clip

This class represents a clip in Live. It can be either an audio clip or a MIDI clip in the Arrangement or Session View, depending on the track / slot it lives in.

## Canonical Paths

live_set tracks N clip_slots M clip
```

```clike

```

## Children

### view [Clip.View](https://docs.cycling74.com/apiref/lom/clip_view/ "Clip.View")read-only

## Properties

### available_warp_modes listread-only

Returns the list of indexes of the Warp Modes available for the clip. Only valid for audio clips.

### color intobserve

The RGB value of the clip's color in the form `0x00rrggbb` or (2^16 * red) + (2^8) * green + blue, where red, green and blue are values from 0 (dark) to 255 (light).

When setting the RGB value, the nearest color from the clip color chooser is taken.

### color_index intobserve

The clip's color index.

### end_marker floatobserve

The end marker of the clip in beats, independent of the loop state. Cannot be set before the start marker.

### end_time floatread-onlyobserve

The end time of the clip. For Session View clips, if Loop is on, this is the Loop End, otherwise it's the End Marker. For Arrangement View clips, this is always the position of the clip's rightmost edge in the Arrangement.

### gain floatobserve

The gain of the clip (range is 0.0 to 1.0). Only valid for audio clips.

### gain_display_string symbolread-only

Get the gain display value of the clip as a string (e.g. "1.3 dB"). Can only be called on audio clips.

### file_path symbolread-only

Get the location of the audio file represented by the clip. Only available for audio clips.

### groove [Groove](https://docs.cycling74.com/apiref/lom/groove/ "Groove")observe

Get/set/observe access to the groove associated with this clip.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### has_envelopes boolread-onlyobserve

Get/observe whether the clip has any automation.

### has_groove boolread-only

### is_session_clip boolread-only

1 = The clip is a Session clip.

A clip can be either an Arrangement or a Session clip.

### is_arrangement_clip boolread-only

1 = The clip is an Arrangement clip.

A clip can be either an Arrangement or a Session clip.

### is_take_lane_clip boolread-only

1 = The clip is a Take Lane clip.

Returns true if the clip is on a Take Lane. Take Lane clips are also Arrangement clips.

### is_audio_clip boolread-only

The Launch Mode of the Clip as an integer index. Available Launch Modes are:

0 = Trigger (default)

1 = Gate

2 = Toggle

3 = Repeat

_Available since Live 11.0._

### launch_quantization intobserve

The Launch Quantization of the Clip as an integer index. Available Launch Quantization values are:

### legato boolobserve

1 = Legato Mode switch in the Clip's Launch settings is on.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### length floatread-only

For looped clips: loop length in beats. Otherwise it's the distance in beats from start to end marker. Makes no sense for unwarped audio clips.

### loop_end floatobserve

For looped clips: loop end.

For unlooped clips: clip end.

### loop_jump bangobserve

Bangs when the clip play position is crossing the loop start marker (possibly projected into the loop).

### loop_start floatobserve

For looped clips: loop start.

For unlooped clips: clip start.

loop_start and loop_end are in absolute clip beat time if clip is MIDI or warped. The 1.1.1 position has beat time 0. If the clip is unwarped audio, they are given in seconds, 0 is the time of the first sample in the audio material.

### looping boolobserve

1 = clip is looped. Unwarped audio cannot be looped.

### muted boolobserve

1 = muted (i.e. the Clip Activator button of the clip is off).

### name symbolobserve

### notes bangobserve

Observer sends bang when the list of notes changes.

Available for MIDI clips only.

### warp_markers dict/bangread-onlyobserve

Observing this property outputs a bang when the Warp Markers change.

Getting this property returns the Warp Markers in a dict as pairs of sample times and beat times:

`sample_time` : [float] the position in seconds in the audio sample file.

`beat_time` : [float] the beat this sample position corresponds to.

To calculate the position in the sample file that corresponds to any given Clip time in beats, Live goes through these steps:\

- Find the Warp Marker with a `beat_time` below the given Clip time and the one above it.

- Get the ratio of the Clip time in beats between the beat times of these two markers.

- Get the `sample_time` for each of these two markers.

- Interpolate between these two sample times with the same ratio to get the file sample position in seconds.


The last Warp Marker in the dict is not visible in the Live interface. This hidden marker is used to calculate the BPM of the last segment.


Available for audio clips only.


_Getting is available since Live 11.0._


### pitch_coarse intobserve

Pitch shift in semitones ("Transpose"), -48 ... 48.

Available for audio clips only.

### pitch_fine floatobserve

Extra pitch shift in cents ("Detune"), -50 ... 49.

Available for audio clips only.

### playing_position floatread-onlyobserve

Current playing position of the clip.

For MIDI and warped audio clips, the value is given in beats of absolute clip time. The clip's beat time of 0 is where 1 is shown in the bar/beat/16th time scale at the top of the clip view.

For unwarped audio clips, the position is given in seconds, according to the time scale shown at the bottom of the clip view.

Stopped clips have a playing position of 0.

### playing_status bangobserve

Observer sends bang when playing/trigger status changes.

### position floatread-onlyobserve

Get and set the clip's loop position. The value will always equal loop_start, however setting this property, unlike setting loop_start, preserves the loop length.

### ram_mode boolobserve

1 = an audio clip’s RAM switch is enabled.

### sample_length intread-only

Length of the Clip's sample, in samples.

### sample_rate floatread-only

Get the Clip's sample rate.

### signature_denominator intobserve

### signature_numerator intobserve

### start_marker floatobserve

The start marker of the clip in beats, independent of the loop state. Cannot be set behind the end marker.

### start_time floatread-onlyobserve

The start time of the clip, relative to the global song time. The value is in beats.

For Arrangement View clips, this is the offset within the arrangement. For Session View clips, this is the time the clip was started. Note that what is reported is the start_time of the currently playing clip on the track, regardless of which clip.

When a Session View clip's playback position was offset by clicking in its time ruler in the Clip Detail View or moving its start marker, its start_time may be negative. This allows using the start_time as an offset when calculating the clip's current playback position based on the global song time.

### velocity_amount floatobserve

How much the velocity of the note that triggers the clip affects its volume, 0 = no effect, 1 = full effect.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### warp_mode intobserve

The Warp Mode of the clip as an integer index. Available Warp Modes are:

0 = Beats Mode

1 = Tones Mode

2 = Texture Mode

3 = Re-Pitch Mode

4 = Complex Mode

5 = REX Mode

6 = Complex Pro Mode

Available for audio clips only.

### warping boolobserve

1 = Warp switch is on.

Available for audio clips only.

Technical note: Internally, Live will defer the setting of this property. This has the consequence that if you are sequencing API calls from a single event, the actual order of operations may differ from what you'd intuitively expect. Most of the time this should be transparent to you, but if you run into issues, please report them.

### will_record_on_start boolread-only

1 for MIDI clips which are in triggered state, with the track armed and MIDI Arrangement Overdub on.

## Functions

### add_new_notes

Parameter:

`dictionary`

Key: `"notes"` [list of note specification dictionaries]

Note specification dictionaries have the following keys:

`pitch` : [int] the MIDI note number, 0...127, 60 is C3.

`start_time` : [float] the note start time in beats of absolute clip time.

`duration` : [float] the note length in beats.

`velocity (optional)` : [float] the note velocity, 0 ... 127 _(100 by default)_.

`mute (optional)` : [bool] 1 = the note is deactivated _(0 by default)_.

`probability (optional)` : [float] the chance that the note will be played:

1.0 = the note is always played

0.0 = the note is never played

_(1.0 by default)_.

`velocity_deviation (optional)` : [float] the range of velocity values at which the note can be played:

0.0 = no deviation; the note will always play at the velocity specified by the _velocity_ property

-127.0 to 127.0 = the note will be assigned a velocity value between _velocity_ and _velocity + velocity_deviation_, inclusive; if the resulting range exceeds the limits of MIDI velocity (0 to 127), then it will be clamped within those limits

_(0.0 by default)_.

`release_velocity (optional)` : [float] the note release velocity _(64 by default)_.

Returns a list of note IDs of the added notes.

For MIDI clips only.

_Available since Live 11.0._

### add_warp_marker

Only available for warped Audio Clips. Adds the specified warp marker, if possible.

The warp marker is specified as a dict which can have a `beat_time` and a `sample_time` key, both associated with float values.

The `sample_time` key may be omitted; in this case, Live will calculate the appropriate sample time to create a warp marker at the specified beat time without changing the Clip's playback timing, similar to what would happen if you were to double-click in the upper half of the Sample Display in Clip View.

If `sample_time` is specified, certain limitations must be taken into account: \

- The sample time must lie within the range _[0, s]_, where _s_ is the sample's length. The `sample_length` Clip property helps with this.

- The sample time must lie between the left and right adjacents markers' respective sample times (this is a logical constraint).

- Within these constraints, there are limitations on the resulting segments' BPM. The allowed BPM range is _[5, 999]_.


### apply_note_modifications

Parameter:

`dictionary`

Key: `"notes"` [list of note dictionaries] as returned from `get_notes_extended`.

The list of note dictionaries passed to the function can be a subset of notes in the clip, but will be ignored if it contains any notes that are not present in the clip.

For MIDI clips only.

_Available since Live 11.0. Replaces modifying notes with remove_notes followed by set_notes._

### clear_all_envelopes

Removes all automation in the clip.

### clear_envelope

Parameter:

`device_parameter` [id]

Removes the automation of the clip for the given parameter.

### crop

Crops the clip: if the clip is looped, the region outside the loop is removed; if it isn't, the region outside the start and end markers.

### deselect_all_notes

Call this before replace_selected_notes if you just want to add some notes.

Output:

`deselect_all_notes id 0`

For MIDI clips only.

### duplicate_loop

Makes the loop two times longer by moving loop_end to the right, and duplicates both the notes and the envelopes. If the clip is not looped, the clip start/end range is duplicated. Available for MIDI clips only.

### duplicate_notes_by_id

Parameter:

`list` of note IDs.

Or `dictionary`

Keys:

`note_ids` [list of note IDs] as returned from `get_notes_extended`

`destination_time (optional)` [float/int]

`transposition_amount (optional)` [int]

Duplicates all notes matching the given note IDs.

Provided note IDs must be associated with existing notes in the clip. Existing notes can be queried with `get_notes_extended`.

The selection of notes will be duplicated to _destination_time_, if provided. Otherwise the new notes will be inserted after the last selected note. This behavior can be observed when duplicating notes in the Live GUI.

If the _transposition_amount_ is specified, the duplicated notes will be transposed by the number of semitones.

Available for MIDI clips only.

_Available since Live 11.1.2_

### duplicate_region

Parameter:

`region_start` [float/int]

`region_length` [float/int]

`destination_time` [float/int]

`pitch (optional)` [int]

`transposition_amount (optional)` [int]

Duplicate the notes in the specified region to the _destination_time_. Only notes of the specified pitch are duplicated or all if _pitch_ is -1. If the _transposition_amount_ is not 0, the notes in the region will be transposed by the _transpose_amount_ of semitones. Available for MIDI clips only.

### fire

0.0 = no deviation; the note will always play at the velocity specified by the _velocity_ property

-127.0 to 127.0 = the note will be assigned a velocity value between _velocity_ and _velocity + velocity_deviation_, inclusive; if the resulting range exceeds the limits of MIDI velocity (0 to 127), then it will be clamped within those limits.

`release_velocity` : [float] the note release velocity.

It is possible to optionally provide the arguments to this function in the form of a single dictionary instead. The dictionary must include all of the parameter names given above as its keys; the associated values are the parameter values you wish to pass to the function.

If you use this method, you can optionally provide an additional key-value pair: the key is "return" and the associated value is a list of the note properties as listed above in the discussion of the returned note dictionaries, e.g. ["note_id", "pitch", "velocity"].
